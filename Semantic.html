    <h1>What are Semantic HTML Tags</h1>
    <p>Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. 

        For example, tags like 'header', 'article', and 'footer' are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain.
        
        On the other hand, tags like 'div' and 'span' are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements. 
        They serve only as content holders but give no indication as to what type of content they contain or what role that content plays on the page.</p>
     <h1>Accessibility</h1>   
     <p>
        For sighted users, it's easy to identify the various parts of a webpage. 
        Headers, footers, and the main content are all immediately visually apparent. 

       However, it is not that easy for users who are blind or visually impaired and rely on screen readers. 

    The proper use of HTML semantic tags will allow these readers to understand your content better 
    because their screen readers will communicate your content more accurately.
